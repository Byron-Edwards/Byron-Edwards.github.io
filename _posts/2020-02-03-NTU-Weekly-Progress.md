### Completion (2020/02/03 - 2020/02/16)

- Completed the [Deep Learning and NLP first assignment](https://github.com/Byron-Edwards/NTU/tree/master/courses/nlp) (The first language model). At the same time, I set up the environment, recap the usage of numpy, pandas and get hands dirty on the Pytorch
- Learnt the RL online courses (David Silver) 1-3  
- Familiar with Markdown
- Paper read:
  - [A Review of Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03963)
  - [On Multi-Agent Learning in Team Sports Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10124)
  - [Winning Isnâ€™t Everything: Enhancing Game Development with Intelligent Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10545)  

### Ideas

- Abount the projects: Both assignment of courses [*Multi-agent*](https://ntulearn.ntu.edu.sg/bbcswebdav/pid-2001367-dt-content-rid-10331026_1/courses/19S2-AI6125/Assignment2_introduction.pdf) and [*AI introduction*](https://ntulearn.ntu.edu.sg/bbcswebdav/pid-2003491-dt-content-rid-10361597_1/courses/19S2-AI6101/RL%20Mini-Project%20%E2%80%93%20How%20to%20Get%20Started.pdf) are related with reinforcement learning, i would like to combine these assignments into the first period of the RL projects

### Questions

Basic

- Q: What's the core difference between value iteration and policy iteration in MDP?
- Q: on-policy traning and off-policy training
- Q: How to better understand the dimension in pytorch
- Q: Can pytorch be used for Java Programming?
- Q: Pytorch distributed (multi node and multi GPU) training

Project related

- Q: Policy understanding of model-free DRL? Is it aim to address the pain point of sparse reward, huge search space.
- Q: Will the hieratical RL, imitation Learning help on this target?
- Q: If we finaly want to used the so called understood policy to accelarate the training process, do it means that we actually build the model of the environment?

### Next Step

- Complete the Multi-agent Assigment [literature review](https://ntulearn.ntu.edu.sg/bbcswebdav/pid-1959486-dt-content-rid-9994760_1/courses/19S2-AI6125/assignment_1.pdf)(due by 2020/02/23)
